# 🚀 Python Fundamentals – Internship Project

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains five foundational Python programs developed as part of an internship assignment.
Each module addresses a real-world scenario commonly encountered in software systems such as authentication, academic evaluation, data preprocessing, message validation, and log monitoring.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate:

* Clean and structured coding practices
* Logical problem-solving ability
* Modular programming design
* Real-world application awareness
* Readable and maintainable code standards
